the function call is stored in the stack
        first is main is called in stack
        then the function is called in the stack
        then the function is called again in the stack
        once the current function is done, it is removed from the stack
        then the previous function is called
        then the main function is called
        then the program ends
        recursion needs a base case to stop the recursion
        if there is no base case, the program will run forever
       it may cause stack overflow error memory

why recursion 
  solving complex problem into simple
  itreate through functions
   in recursion  space complexity the space complexity is not constant
   recursive tree

     forming formula using recursion
